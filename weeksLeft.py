# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many weeks we have left, if we live until 90 years old.
#
# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
#
# You have x weeks left.
# Where x is replaced with the actual calculated number of weeks the input age has left until age 90.

# age = input("Write your age:")
#
# all_We_Have=(int(90*52))
# New_age=(int(age))
# New_age*=52
# left_weeks=(int(all_We_Have - New_age))
# print("You have ",left_weeks, "weeks left")
name =input("name:")
print("you are"+name)
